-- | Chapter 2 - TERMS,TYPES AND KINDS
-- 
-- In everyday Haskell programming, the fundamental 
-- building blocks are those of terms and types.
-- 
-- Terms: the values you can manipulateâ€”the things that exist at runtime.
-- Types: little more than sanity-checks: proofs to the compiler (and ourselves)
-- 
-- The fundamental building blocks for `type-level programming` are types and kinds.
-- 
-- Kind: the type system for types / the types of types
-- Types: the things to manipulate

-- | Kinds (denoted * and called 'type')
-- (*) that the type is a concrete type. A concrete type is a type that doesn't take any type parameters and values can only have types that are concrete types.
-- 
-- You can check kind in prelude using :kind ...
-- 
-- # Nullary type constructors
-- 
-- Integer
-- Have kind `*` it's mean: kind of all nullary type constructors
kind :: Integer
kind = 5

-- # Unary type constructors
-- 
-- Maybe
-- Have kind `* -> *` : kind with type parameter
-- it's called unary type constructor, because have one concrete type parameters,
-- 
-- Maybe :: * -> *
-- Maybe Int :: *
kindT' :: Maybe Int -- type parameters solved
kindT' = Just 1

-- Either:: * -> * -> *
-- have two concrete type parameters 
kindT2' :: Either Int Bool
kindT2' = Left 1

-- # Arrow kinds
-- same like either, have two concrete type parameters 
-- (->): * -> * -> *

-- # Higher-kinded types (HKTs)
-- `(* -> *) -> *`
-- `* -> (* -> *)`
-- 
-- Rules: Everything above order/rank 1 is called higher-order, higher-rank or higher-kinded
-- 
-- Functor :: (* -> *) -> Constraint
